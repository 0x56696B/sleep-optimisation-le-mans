Given a team X, with 3 drivers: A, B, and C.
A - 20 year old with 2 years racing experience. Last night he slept for 6 hours
B - 24 year old with 6 years racing experience. Last night he slept for 10 hours
C - 29 year old with 8 years racing experience. Last night he slept for 9 hours
They are on one team racing for 24h straight.
How can they optimize their sleeping schedule, so all of them have peek energy during the race.
And how can we order them, so they extract the most amount of laps from every single one with fewest amounts of driver rotations?
